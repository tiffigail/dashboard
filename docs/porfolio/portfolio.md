# Gearshift App Context Document

## General

### 1. Overview and Premise

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Gearshift WebApp. This web application serves as a "gearshift" to the user's experience, perspective, and focus. It is intended to help the user navigate long term goals and projects and is organized into a series of interconnected dashboards or "views" designed to help the user stay oriented, increase motivation and stamina, and optimize their experience. The web app has built in data collection modals so the user can track progress and gain insight into how their brain works. It is a sub-project within the "Gear Axis" of the broader Pareto Project (5-year plan). The primary goal of this application is to enable the user to identify the most productive 20% of efforts within chosen life axes, fostering unexpected insights and a sense of completion. It aims to provide a structured framework for intentional living, ensuring that 100% of efforts become effective by focusing on the 20% most impactful actions within five key areas.

### 2. Core Features and Functionality

The Gearshift WebApp is built around several core concepts designed to help the user optimize focus, manage energy, and align actions with long-term values. The functionality emerges from the interplay of these foundational elements:

**The Five Axes of Focus: A Framework for Holistic Progress**

The web app divides goals into 5 Axes, which provide a comprehensive framework for the user to categorize and balance their efforts across all significant areas of life. This structure ensures that goal setting and activity tracking are not siloed but contribute to a holistic vision of personal development. Developing different areas concurrently allows the user to make connections and accelerate growth. By assigning tasks, routines, and reflections to specific axes, the user can visually and analytically assess where their energy is flowing and identify areas that may need more or less attention, aligning with the Pareto principle of focused effort. These axes could be customized for individual users if the web app expanded, but the specific axes chosen by the creator are as follows:

* Misdirect: strategic distractions
* Physical: mastery of movement
* Financial: survival and funding endeavors
* Mental: mind control and values alignment
* Environment: shaping surroundings

**Views: Training Perspective and Navigating Different Levels of Focus**

The application utilizes a system of interconnected views that allow the user to adjust perspective, seamlessly "zooming" in and out of their life's activities and goals.

* **Life View:** A timeline of the user’s life and overall stats
* **Pareto View:** An outline of the user’s current 5 year project and stretch goals for each project.
* **Yearly View:** An outline of the user’s current yearly goals and progress
* **Month View:** Time Based theming that doesn’t necessarily relate to any Axis
* **Weekly View:** designed for higher-level planning and thematic organization, aligning days with specific axes.
* **Daily View:** offers a more granular look at the current day's themed tasks, emotional state, and progress within the weekly theme.
* **Now View:** provides an immediate, focused interface for the current task or Pomodoro cycle, minimizing distractions and maximizing concentration.

This multi-level approach helps the user maintain context, connecting immediate actions in the "Now" to broader daily, weekly, and long-term objectives, avoid overwhelming the user and fostering a sense of directed purpose.

**Data Collection via Modals: Intentional Input and Reflection**

Modals are used for focused data entry. This design choice encourages intentional interaction and reflection at key moments. Instead of continuous, potentially distracting input fields, modals present a structured opportunity for the user to pause, assess, and record specific information . This method not only captures valuable data for later analysis but also reinforces the reflective practice that is central to the app's philosophy of understanding and optimizing one's own work patterns and mental state. It helps the user evaluate performance and stay on track.

### 3. Target Audience and Use Cases

The Gearshift WebApp is specifically tailored for an individual, "Abi Harrison," who is seeking to enhance motivation, build stamina, and cultivate a stronger sense of purpose. The application supports this by providing a structured, experimental framework for intentional living over an extended period.

The primary use cases for the Gearshift WebApp are designed to address common challenges and aspirations in personal development:

* **Creating a meaningful life:** By offering a clear structure and a means to track progress towards meaningful goals, the app helps the user regain a sense of direction and purpose, counteracting feelings of aimlessness.
* **Enhancing Productivity and Focus:** The application enables the user to identify and prioritize the 20% of actions that yield 80% of results (the Pareto Principle) within their chosen life axes. This leads to more effective use of time and energy, and a reduction in effort spent on less impactful activities.
* **Facilitating Personal Growth through Self-Experimentation:** Gearshift serves as a long-term platform for personal experimentation. It encourages the user to observe their patterns, adapt their strategies based on data-driven insights, and discover unforeseen connections and areas for growth.

## 6. Core Components: In-Depth

This section provides a more detailed examination of the foundational components of the Gearshift WebApp: Axes, Views, and Modals. Understanding these elements is key to grasping how the application supports the user in achieving their goals.

### Axes

The five core Axes provide a framework for dividing life into key areas for observation, experimentation, and focused effort. These core Axes, along with "Rest and Preparation" and "On Track: N+1," are also utilized for daily time-based theming within the application, particularly in the Weekly and Daily Views. Each Axis has a distinct purpose, Stretch Goal, and underlying philosophy.

**Misdirect: Strategic Distractions**

* **Purpose:** To employ strategic distractions to maintain productivity, prevent fatigue, and endure to the end.
* **Stretch Goal:** Use distraction strategically to prolong total periods of productivity. Use Misdirects to recharge, to shift, to surf the Ebbs and Flows of Reality
* **Rationale & Philosophy:** Misdirection is a tool to prevent fatigue and allow for prolonged, effective focus by providing necessary breaks and shifts in perspective. Each Axis can seem like a misdirect from the perspective of another, yet all contribute to a whole. This approach involves trusting the brain's innate ability to sort and process information even when not actively focused on it. From the perspective of any single Axis, the other 80% of activities can be reframed as rest and regrouping, rather than an endless grind. Crucially, a misdirect must be balanced by an eventual intentional redirect. It's about "leaving so we can come back again," using the disorienting nature of misdirection to then re-orient with fresh perspective.

**Physical: Mastery of Movement**

* **Purpose:** To achieve mastery of movement and make My body an "optical illusion."
* **Stretch Goal:** Master Puppeteering my Body. Learn to move like an optical illusion. I want my body to be valued for its use and capability rather than solely its appearance.
* **Rationale & Philosophy:** This Axis evolved from a desire to move without shame to a deeper goal of self-mastery and being fully present in the body. The body is seen as a vessel for sentience, and the ultimate achievement is for sentience to control it seamlessly, to become the body. It aims to overcome feelings of pain or dissociation, allowing the user to "feel what it's like to know what YOU as a body want, and to be able to move just exactly so with precision and timing." This is an act of respect and gratitude for life, addressing past negative experiences and reclaiming the joy of movement for intrinsic expression. The "optical illusion" concept emphasizes shifting value from appearance to purposeful action and power.

**Financial: Create Abundance**

* **Purpose:** To ensure survival in this reality and to fund all other endeavors.
* **Stretch Goal:** To survive, fund other endeavors (including a downpayment for a farm), and "Win the Lottery on purpose." (Also noted: "Save 18000 in an emergency fund, start down payment, PMP").
* **Rationale & Philosophy:** This Axis aims to shift the perspective on money from a mysterious, uncontrollable force to something where hard work has monetary value that can be strategically pursued. It addresses the fear and shame associated with past poverty and the feeling of powerlessness over finances. The initial "lottery" metaphor represents a desperate hope, but evolves into a desire to "win the lottery on purpose" by aligning one's own values with what others value, leading to a fulfilling exchange. Recognizing that treating money as impossible to earn can be a defense mechanism, the goal is to reclaim control and understand that earning is based on value. The "Boxcar Children" metaphor signifies a richness based on treasuring what one has, resourcefulness, and gratitude.

**Mental: GearShift**

* **Purpose:** To achieve mind control. Of my mind, maybe more.
* **Stretch Goal:** Create a system of mind control that allows me to maximize the brain I have.
* **Rationale & Philosophy:** The "Liahona" (a navigational device in the Book of Mormon) serves as a central metaphor for a core component of the mind. The Liahona works when its users’ actions and beliefs align with the values of the creator of the Liahona (God). When your actions and beliefs align with what you truly value, the mind (Liahona) calibrates to show the steps needed to achieve desires, balancing reward and punishment to create intrinsic motivation. The "GearShift" effort is an attempt to understand these mental processes, fine-tune map creating and map following skills, rather than trying to control fate from a limited perspective. It acknowledges that gut feelings can be "scrambled by shame and fear," and the higher mind is needed for clear navigation.

**Environment: Shaping Surroundings**

* **Purpose:** To demonstrate and experience personal power by controlling one's environment.
* **Stretch Goal:** To create a space that is a reflection of my inner mind, in which I can reside.
* **Rationale & Philosophy:** We define ourselves both internally and in relation to our surroundings. Because our minds are mirrors, our perspective of our environment reflects our inner mind. Taking control of our environment is then reflected in the mind.
